## 📂 `classes/` — Apex Controllers, Handlers, Wrappers & Tests

### 1. `EventBookingController.cls`
- **Role:** Main backend controller backing the **Attendee Portal** (`attendeeEventBooking` LWC).
- **Sharing Mode:** `public without sharing class`
  > **Why `without sharing`?** In this CRM, `Event__c` has a `Private` Org-Wide Default (OWD) and is owned by Event Organizers. Attendees are external/portal users. Declaring this class `without sharing` allows authenticated attendees to discover approved, published events and retrieve ticket tiers. Security is enforced programmatically in Apex: `getMyTickets()` and `confirmPayment()` strictly filter by `UserInfo.getUserId()`.
- **Key Methods:**
  - `getPublishedEvents()`: Fetches all approved, published events where `Registration_Status__c = 'Open'`.
  - `getEventDetail(Id eventId)`: Retrieves full event specifications including venue address and assigned speakers (`Speakers__r`).
  - `getEventTicketTypes(Id eventId)`: Returns active ticket tiers with real-time remaining quota (`Available_Seats__c`) and price in ₹.
  - `bookMultipleTickets(Id eventId, Id ticketTypeId, List<AttendeeInput> attendees)`:
    - Atomically processes multi-ticket group bookings.
    - Generates a unique `Booking_Group_Id__c` (e.g. `GRP-1725530000-842`).
    - Creates $N$ `Attendee__c` records and $N$ `Registration__c` records in `Pending` status.
    - Returns primary registration ID and group ID to LWC.
  - `confirmPayment(Id registrationId, String transactionRef)`:
    - Bulk payment verification: updates all registrations under the same `Booking_Group_Id__c` from `Pending` to `Confirmed`.
    - Creates corresponding `Payment__c` records with payment method `UPI` and status `Completed`.
    - Issues active `Ticket__c` records with unique autonumbers (`TKT-XXXXX`).
    - Contains idempotency guards to prevent double-charging or duplicate ticket generation.
  - `getMyTickets()`: Queries all confirmed tickets belonging to the logged-in user via `Registration__r.Attendee__r.User__c = :currentUserId`.

---

### 2. `OrganizerDashboardController.cls`
- **Role:** Controller backing the executive **Organizer Dashboard** (`organizerDashboard` LWC).
- **Sharing Mode:** `public with sharing class`
- **Key Methods:**
  - `getMyEvents()`: 
    - Dynamically evaluates if the logged-in user is an **Event Manager** (`Event_Manager_Permissions` or role `Event_Manager`) or **Event Organizer**.
    - If Manager: queries **all events** organization-wide to monitor organizational performance.
    - If Organizer: filters by `WHERE Organizer__c = :currentUserId` so organizers only see their own assigned events.
    - Aggregates metrics into `EventSummaryWrapper`: Total Capacity, Booked Seats, Available Seats, Confirmed Registrations, and Realized Revenue in ₹.

---

### 3. `PrintableTicketExtension.cls`
- **Role:** Controller backing the printable PDF admission pass (`pages/PrintableTicket.page`).
- **Sharing Mode:** `public without sharing class`
- **Key Architecture:**
  - Provides a **no-arg constructor** for custom Visualforce page controller usage: parses `?id=` parameter directly from `ApexPages.currentPage().getParameters()`.
  - Provides a **StandardController constructor** (`ApexPages.StandardController`) for test harness execution.
  - Detects single-attendee passes vs **Multi-Attendee Group Passes**: queries all sibling tickets sharing the same `Booking_Group_Id__c` to build the complete `groupTickets` roster.
  - Calculates total price paid across all passes in ₹.

---

### 4. `RegistrationTriggerHandler.cls`
- **Role:** Business logic handler executed before insert of `Registration__c`.
- **Key Architecture & Validations:**
  - **Bulkified Validation:** Queries parent `Event__c` and `Ticket_Type__c` in a single SOQL query.
  - **Event Registration Status Guard:** Blocks registrations if event registration status is closed or not open.
  - **Ticket Type Status Guard:** Prevents booking against 'Sold Out' or 'Closed' ticket tiers.
  - **Atomic Quota Protection:** Maintains an in-memory `runningBookedByTicketType` map. If 50 simultaneous registrations arrive in a bulk transaction, it sums them and verifies `bookedSoFar + incomingCount <= quota`.
  - **Auto-Sold-Out Transition:** If the batch fills the final remaining seat, it immediately marks the `Ticket_Type__c` as `Sold Out`.

---

### 5. `TicketTypeTriggerHandler.cls`
- **Role:** Business logic handler for `Ticket_Type__c` before insert and before update.
- **Key Architecture & Validations:**
  - **Venue Capacity Guard:** Ensures that the sum of quotas across all ticket types for an event never exceeds the venue's physical capacity (`Venue__r.Venue_Capacity__c`).
  - **Sibling Aggregate SOQL:** Uses `[SELECT Event__c, SUM(Quota__c) FROM Ticket_Type__c GROUP BY Event__c]` to account for existing tiers when inserting or updating new tiers.

---

### 6. `PaymentGatewayService.cls`
- **Role:** Enterprise Payment Gateway Service implementing the Adapter Pattern.
- **Key Architecture & Security:**
  - **Zero-Code Switching:** Uses Custom Metadata (`Payment_Gateway_Config__mdt`) to toggle between Sandbox simulation and live gateway settlements (Razorpay/Cashfree).
  - **UPI Intent Generation:** Produces NPCI-compliant `upi://pay?pa={vpa}&pn=EventManagement&am={amount}&tn={ref}&cu=INR` URIs readable by any phone scanner.
  - **HMAC-SHA256 Webhook Verification:** Verifies payload integrity and digital signatures via `Crypto.generateMac('HmacSHA256', ...)` to eliminate client-side tampering.

---

### 7. `TicketTypeWrapper.cls`
- **Role:** Apex-Defined Data Type (DTO) used by the Screen Flow (`Event_Creation_Screen_Flow`) and LWC (`ticketTypeCollector`).
- **Fields:** `name` (String), `price` (Decimal), `quota` (Decimal), `description` (String).

---

### 8. Apex Test Classes (100% Pass Rate - 41 Tests)
- `EventBookingControllerTest.cls`: Tests event queries, multi-ticket booking, atomic quota overflow failures, payment idempotency, and ticket roster generation.
- `OrganizerDashboardControllerTest.cls`: Tests dashboard metric aggregation, revenue calculations, and empty-state handling.
- `PaymentGatewayServiceTest.cls`: Tests metadata config fetching, UPI payload generation, sandbox order initialization, and HMAC-SHA256 signature verification.
- `RegistrationTriggerHandlerTest.cls`: Tests quota boundaries, sold-out triggers, closed events, and bulk safety.
- `TicketTypeTriggerHandlerTest.cls`: Tests venue capacity overflow enforcement and sibling quota updates.
- `OrganizerJourneyE2ETest.cls`: End-to-end integration test simulating the entire Organizer lifecycle: event creation, capacity checks, budget approval submission, and manager approval/rejection.
- `AttendeeJourneyE2ETest.cls`: End-to-end integration test simulating the Attendee lifecycle: browsing events, reserving tickets, making payments, and viewing tickets.

## 📂 `triggers/` — Apex Database Triggers

### 1. `RegistrationTrigger.trigger`
```apex
trigger RegistrationTrigger on Registration__c (before insert) {
    RegistrationTriggerHandler.beforeInsert(Trigger.new);
}
```
- Implements the **One-Trigger-Per-Object** enterprise pattern.
- Completely delegates business logic to `RegistrationTriggerHandler`.

### 2. `TicketTypeTrigger.trigger`
```apex
trigger TicketTypeTrigger on Ticket_Type__c (before insert, before update) {
    if (Trigger.isBefore) {
        if (Trigger.isInsert) {
            TicketTypeTriggerHandler.beforeInsert(Trigger.new);
        } else if (Trigger.isUpdate) {
            TicketTypeTriggerHandler.beforeUpdate(Trigger.new, Trigger.oldMap);
        }
    }
}
```
- Context-aware routing: routes new tiers to `beforeInsert` and modifications to `beforeUpdate`.

# 3. Viva & Project Defense Cheat Sheet (Q&A for Sir)

### Q1: "Why did you declare `EventBookingController` as `without sharing`?"
> **Answer:** *"In our CRM, `Event__c` has a Private Org-Wide Default (OWD) so that organizers only manage their own events. However, Attendees are public/portal users who need to discover open, approved events. If the controller was `with sharing`, the private OWD would return 0 events to attendees. By using `without sharing`, attendees can query published events, while record-level security on payments and tickets is strictly enforced programmatically using `UserInfo.getUserId()`."*

### Q2: "How do you prevent overbooking if 100 users try to book the last 5 tickets simultaneously?"
> **Answer:** *"We enforce capacity at two distinct layers:
> 1. In `EventBookingController.cls`, we query remaining seats and validate before creating pending registrations.
> 2. In `RegistrationTriggerHandler.cls`, we use an in-memory tracking map (`runningBookedByTicketType`) that calculates running sums across all records in the execution batch. If the total exceeds the ticket type's quota, it calls `addError()` to rollback the transaction. If it fills the quota exactly, it atomically flips the status to 'Sold Out'."*

### Q3: "Why did you use a Custom Controller instead of a StandardController on `PrintableTicket.page`?"
> **Answer:** *"Initially, we had `standardController='Ticket__c'`. But in Salesforce, `Ticket__c` inherits sharing from `Registration__c`, which inherits from `Event__c` (Private OWD). When a standard controller executes with an ID parameter, Salesforce runs an internal pre-flight query in the user's sharing context. For an attendee who doesn't own the event, Salesforce threw a `NoDataFoundException`. Switching to a custom controller (`PrintableTicketExtension`) allows our Apex code to run with elevated privileges to generate the PDF pass while still validating that the ticket belongs to the user."*

### Q4: "How does the Screen Flow interact with the custom LWC component `ticketTypeCollector`?"
> **Answer:** *"We used Apex-Defined Data Types. We created an Apex class `TicketTypeWrapper` with `@AuraEnabled` fields (`name`, `price`, `quota`, `description`). The LWC defines `@api ticketTypes` and emits `FlowAttributeChangeEvent` whenever a user adds or removes a row. Flow receives this collection, loops through it, and performs a bulk insert."*

### Q5: "What is your budget approval threshold and how is it configurable?"
> **Answer:** *"Our threshold is ₹2,00,000 (2 Lakhs INR). Rather than hardcoding this number in Apex or Flow, we stored it in a Custom Metadata Type (`Approval_Settings__mdt.Default_Threshold`). Both our Screen Flow and Approval Process dynamically query this threshold. If leadership ever wants to change the threshold to ₹5,00,000, an admin can change it in Setup without modifying any code."*

### Q6: "Why is there only one trigger on `Registration__c`?"
> **Answer:** *"We follow Salesforce Enterprise Architecture Best Practices: One Trigger Per Object. Multiple triggers on the same object have non-deterministic execution orders. Having a single trigger that delegates to `RegistrationTriggerHandler` guarantees consistent execution order, clean bulkification, and high testability."*
