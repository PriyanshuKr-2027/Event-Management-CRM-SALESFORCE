# ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURAL REMEDIATION & PRODUCTION ROADMAP
## Salesforce Event Management CRM: Production-Grade Alternatives & Architectural Justifications

> **Document Type:** Technical Architecture Review & Enterprise Remediation Report  
> **Prepared For:** Engineering Leadership, Technical Architects & Academic Evaluators ("Sir")  
> **Scope:** Upgrading Academic/Prototype Patterns to Production-Grade Salesforce Architecture

---

## 1. Executive Summary

During our technical review, 5 core architectural areas were identified where rapid-prototyping compromises (standard in student or MVP projects) must be replaced with **production-grade enterprise architecture**:

1. **Payment Verification:** Replacing client-side mock timers with **Asynchronous Gateway Webhook & HMAC Verification**.
2. **Security & Sharing:** Replacing blanket `without sharing` with **Least-Privilege Guest User Architecture & Elevated Worker Queues**.
3. **Entry Pass Generation:** Replacing 2006-era Visualforce PDF (`renderAs="pdf"`) with **Headless DocGen Microservices & Apple/Google Wallet Passes**.
4. **Data Integrity & Cascade Deletes:** Replacing fragile Master-Detail chains with **Immutable Financial Ledger Lookups & Soft Deletion**.
5. **Approval Governance:** Replacing single-value Custom Metadata with **Multi-Tier Dynamic Approval Matrices & Escalation Chains**.

Below is the detailed blueprint for each area, including **what to implement**, **why ONLY that solution works**, and **exact implementation blueprints**.

---

## 2. Issue 1: Payment Verification (Mock Timer vs. Real Gateway Webhook)

### Current Implementation & Vulnerability
- **Current State:** The LWC `paymentQrVerification` generates a static UPI string and runs a client-side JavaScript `setInterval` for 3 seconds before marking the payment as `Approved`.
- **Vulnerability:** **Zero financial security.** Any user can open Chrome DevTools, inspect the component, dispatch a `paymentsuccess` event, and obtain a valid ticket without paying a single rupee. Furthermore, network dropouts or closed browser tabs leave registrations stuck in limbo.

---

### Recommended Enterprise Solution: Asynchronous Webhook Architecture with HMAC-SHA256 Signature Verification

```
[Attendee Browser / LWC]           [Payment Gateway: Razorpay/Stripe]         [Salesforce Apex REST API]
         |                                         |                                       |
         |-- 1. Request Order (Amount, RegId) ---->|                                       |
         |<-- 2. Returns order_id & UPI QR --------|                                       |
         |                                         |                                       |
         |-- 3. Customer scans & pays via PhonePe -|                                       |
                                                   |-- 4. Inbound Webhook (POST JSON) ---->|
                                                   |      Header: X-Signature (HMAC-SHA256)|
                                                   |                                       |-- 5. Verify HMAC Secret
                                                   |                                       |-- 6. Match Registration__c
                                                   |<-- 7. HTTP 200 OK Response -----------|-- 7. Insert Payment__c & Ticket__c
                                                   |                                       |-- 8. Publish Platform Event
         |<-- 9. Receives EMP-API notification ----+---------------------------------------|
```

#### Implementation Details:
1. **Salesforce Inbound REST Service:** Expose a secure public Apex REST endpoint (`@RestResource(urlMapping='/api/v1/payment/webhook/*')`).
2. **Cryptographic Signature Verification:** Use Salesforce native `Crypto.generateMac('HmacSHA256', ...)` to verify that the webhook payload originated from the real payment gateway using a shared secret stored in **Salesforce Named Credentials / Encrypted Key Vault**.
3. **Idempotency & State Locking:** Use a unique `Gateway_Transaction_Id__c` field marked as **Unique & External ID** to prevent double-crediting if the gateway retries the webhook.
4. **Real-Time Client Notification:** The webhook updates the database and fires a **Platform Event** (`Payment_Success__e`). The LWC frontend listens to this channel via **empApi (Streaming API)** to automatically advance the checkout wizard.

---

### Why ONLY This Solution?

1. **Elimination of Client-Side Trust (Zero-Trust Model):**
   - In financial systems, the frontend is considered hostile territory. By decoupling payment confirmation from the client browser, a user *cannot* cheat the system by inspecting element, blocking scripts, or injecting falsified payloads.
2. **Webhook Idempotency:**
   - Gateways like Razorpay, Stripe, or Cashfree retry webhooks up to 72 hours if your server fails to respond. Marking the transaction ID as an External ID and verifying signatures ensures payments are neither missed nor duplicated.
3. **Resilience to Browser Drops:**
   - If an attendee scans the UPI QR code on their phone and their laptop battery dies, the webhook still commits the payment in Salesforce, generates the ticket, and emails the PDF receipt.

---

## 3. Issue 2: Data Access & Sharing (Blanket `without sharing` vs. Elevated Worker Pattern)

### Current Implementation & Vulnerability
- **Current State:** `EventBookingController.cls` is declared `public without sharing class` so that unauthenticated guest attendees can search for events and create registration records.
- **Vulnerability:** Running an entire controller in `without sharing` executes all SOQL and DML in **System Mode**. If an attacker tampers with input parameters (e.g. passing arbitrary record IDs into internal methods), they could query or overwrite events, venues, or financial balances that they have no right to touch.

---

### Recommended Enterprise Solution: Guest User Security Model + Elevated Worker Pattern

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                        1. PUBLIC PORTAL CONTROLLER                                |
|                  `public with sharing class EventBookingPortalController`          |
|  - Runs strictly in USER MODE (`WITH USER_MODE`)                                  |
|  - SOQL protected by Guest User Sharing Rules (Only Active/Published Events)     |
|  - Sanitizes and validates all incoming parameters                                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
                                         |
                                         v [Passes Clean DTO]
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                        2. ELEVATED REGISTRATION WORKER                             |
|          `public without sharing class EventRegistrationExecutionWorker`           |
|  - Private/Internal scope (cannot be called directly by AuraEnabled endpoints)    |
|  - Executes single atomic transaction: Inserts Attendee -> Registration -> Ticket|
|  - Strictly enforces capacity check with `FOR UPDATE` lock                        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

#### Implementation Details:
1. **Public-Facing Controller (`with sharing`):**
   - Enforce Salesforce Winter '21 Guest User Policies: Guest users only get Read access to `Event__c` records where `Status__c = 'Published'` and `Start_Date_Time__c > NOW` via **Guest User Sharing Rules**.
   - All SOQL queries use `WITH USER_MODE` to automatically enforce Field-Level Security.
2. **Elevated Execution Worker (`without sharing`):**
   - A dedicated internal service class containing ONLY the transaction commit logic.
   - The worker cannot be invoked directly via `@AuraEnabled` without passing through validation layers.

---

### Why ONLY This Solution?

1. **Compliance with Salesforce AppExchange Security Review:**
   - Salesforce Security review will automatically flag any `@AuraEnabled` class marked `without sharing` that accepts parameters from a guest context.
2. **Mitigation of SOQL Injection & Data Harvesting:**
   - If an attacker attempts to query unpublished internal drafts or financial reports, the `with sharing` + `WITH USER_MODE` query fails immediately at the database compiler level.
3. **Architectural Separation of Concerns:**
   - The boundary between "what the user is allowed to request" and "what the system needs elevated privileges to create" is explicitly demarcated.

---

## 4. Issue 3: Entry Pass Generation (Visualforce PDF vs. Headless DocGen / Mobile Wallet)

### Current Implementation & Vulnerability
- **Current State:** `PrintableTicket.page` uses `<apex:page renderAs="pdf">`.
- **Vulnerability:** 
  - Visualforce PDF uses **Flying Saucer** (an XML-to-PDF parser dating back to 2006).
  - It does not support modern CSS3 (`flexbox`, CSS grid, modern web fonts, modern SVG).
  - It crashes or mangles layout on complex styling, and has a strict 33,000-word / 15MB heap limit.
  - Furthermore, modern attendees expect a **Mobile Wallet Pass** on their iPhone / Android phone, not an A4 printable PDF document.

---

### Recommended Enterprise Solution: Dual-Channel Delivery (Headless Document Microservice + Apple/Google Wallet Passes)

```
[Salesforce Apex / Trigger]
         |
         +---> 1. High-Resolution Vector PDF (External DocGen Microservice / Puppeteer API)
         |        - Initiated via Named Credential Callout
         |        - Generates print-ready vector PDF with encrypted QR code
         |        - Attaches directly to Registration__c as a Salesforce File (ContentVersion)
         |
         +---> 2. Mobile Wallet (.pkpass / Google Wallet JWT)
                  - Apex generates cryptographically signed JSON pass definition
                  - Sends push link to attendee: "Add to Apple Wallet / Google Pay"
                  - Offline-ready, GPS-triggered lock screen notification at venue
```

---

### Why ONLY This Solution?

1. **Pixel-Perfect CSS3 & Modern Branding:**
   - External document rendering (via Headless Chrome/Puppeteer, Docraptor, or OmniStudio DocGen) supports modern flexbox, crisp vector SVGs, gradients, and custom brand fonts.
2. **Frictionless On-Site Entry (Mobile Wallet):**
   - When attendees arrive at the physical venue coordinates, Apple Wallet and Google Pay automatically display the ticket QR code on the attendee's lock screen using native geo-fencing.
   - Entrance scanners scan Apple Wallet passes significantly faster than zoomed-in PDF attachments on mobile browsers.
3. **No Visualforce Heap / CPU Governor Limit Impact:**
   - Heavy rendering is offloaded from the Salesforce transaction thread, keeping Apex execution times under 50 milliseconds.

---

## 5. Issue 4: Data Model & Financial Cascades (Master-Detail vs. Immutable Audit Lookups)

### Current Implementation & Vulnerability
- **Current State:** 
  `Event__c` $\xrightarrow{\text{Master-Detail}}$ `Registration__c` $\xrightarrow{\text{Master-Detail}}$ `Payment__c`.
- **Vulnerability:** **Catastrophic Data Loss via Cascade Delete.**
  - If an organizer deletes or cancels an `Event__c`, Salesforce automatically executes a cascading delete of all child `Registration__c` and `Payment__c` records.
  - In real business operations, **deleting financial transaction history is illegal** under accounting regulations (e.g., GST, IRS, SOX compliance). Deleting an event must never delete the financial ledger showing money received or refunded.

---

### Recommended Enterprise Solution: Lookup Relationships with Code-Driven Rollups + Immutability Architecture

```
[Event__c] 
    |
    +====(Master-Detail)====> [Ticket_Type__c]  (Legitimate cascade - inventory belongs to event)
    |
    +----(Lookup: Restricted Delete)----> [Registration__c]
                                                |
                                                +----(Lookup: Restricted Delete)----> [Payment__c]
```

#### Implementation Details:
1. **Change Relationship Type:**
   - Change `Registration__c -> Payment__c` and `Event__c -> Registration__c` from **Master-Detail** to **Lookup Relationship**.
2. **Enable "Don't allow deletion of the lookup record":**
   - Set deletion behavior to: *"Don't allow deletion of the lookup record that's part of a lookup relationship."*
   - An event with registrations cannot be deleted; it must be formally transitioned to `Status__c = 'Cancelled'`.
3. **DLRS or Trigger-Driven Rollups:**
   - Replace standard Roll-up Summary fields with **Declarative Lookup Rollup Summaries (DLRS)** or an asynchronous rollup framework to calculate `Total_Revenue__c`.
4. **Append-Only Payment Ledger (Immutability):**
   - Create a trigger on `Payment__c` that throws an error on `before delete` context for all users except System Administrators.
   - When an event is cancelled, issue a **Refund Payment Record** (with negative amount) instead of deleting the original payment record.

---

### Why ONLY This Solution?

1. **Statutory & Financial Compliance:**
   - Financial audit trails require an **append-only ledger**. If ₹50,000 was collected and ₹50,000 was refunded, you must retain two distinct records: the credit transaction and the debit transaction.
2. **Protection Against Accidental Operational Catastrophe:**
   - A single click by a tired junior event coordinator cannot accidentally wipe out months of ticket sales and financial history.
3. **Independent Record Ownership:**
   - Finance teams can own and manage `Payment__c` records under separate sharing rules without inheriting access restrictions from the `Event__c` record.

---

## 6. Issue 5: Approval Architecture (Single Hardcoded CMDT vs. Multi-Tier Matrix)

### Current Implementation & Vulnerability
- **Current State:** A single custom metadata record `Approval_Settings__mdt.Default_Threshold` with a hardcoded value of `200,000`.
- **Vulnerability:** Real organizations do not have a single flat budget threshold. A small workshop with a ₹50,000 budget might need zero approvals, a ₹5,00,000 regional summit needs the Event Director, and a ₹50,00,000 international conference requires VP of Marketing and CFO sign-off. Hardcoding a single flat number forces either approval fatigue (too many low approvals) or financial risk (massive budgets slipping through).

---

### Recommended Enterprise Solution: Multi-Tier Approval Matrix with Dynamic Approver Routing

```
[Event Budget Submitted]
         |
         v
[Query Approval_Matrix__mdt based on Category & Amount]
         |
         +---> Tier 1 (₹0 - ₹1,00,000): Auto-Approved (No bottleneck)
         |
         +---> Tier 2 (₹1,00,001 - ₹5,00,000): 1-Step Approval -> Event_Manager Role
         |
         +---> Tier 3 (₹5,00,001 - ₹20,00,000): 2-Step Sequential -> Manager + Finance Director
         |
         +---> Tier 4 (> ₹20,00,000): Executive Committee -> CFO + VP of Operations
```

#### Custom Metadata Schema: `Approval_Matrix__mdt`
- `Category__c` (Picklist: Conference, Webinar, Workshop, Gala)
- `Lower_Limit__c` (Currency)
- `Upper_Limit__c` (Currency)
- `Approver_Type__c` (Role, Queue, or Manager Hierarchy)
- `Approver_Target__c` (e.g. `Finance_Reviewers_Queue`)
- `Requires_Executive_Signoff__c` (Boolean)

---

### Why ONLY This Solution?

1. **Scalability Across Departments:**
   - As new categories of events are launched (e.g. Global Summits, Virtual Hackathons), administrators can configure new approval thresholds in Setup without modifying a single line of Flow or Apex.
2. **Elimination of Approver Fatigue:**
   - Senior executives are not spammed with approval requests for small college meetups, preserving their attention for multi-lakh investments.
3. **Audit Readiness:**
   - Corporate governance auditors specifically examine whether delegation of financial authority (DOA) is segmented by risk and transaction value.

## 7. Comparative Summary Table (Academic vs. Enterprise Architecture)

| Component | Current Academic Implementation | Enterprise Production Architecture | Primary Architectural Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Payment Verification** | Client-side `setInterval` timer (3s) | Apex Inbound REST Webhook with HMAC-SHA256 signature verification | **Zero-Trust Security:** Prevents client-side tampering; guarantees bank-grade delivery. |
| **Data Sharing** | `public without sharing` on public controller | `with sharing` + `WITH USER_MODE` + internal elevated worker | **Defense-in-Depth:** Protects against unauthorized record leakage; passes AppExchange review. |
| **Entry Pass** | Visualforce PDF (`renderAs="pdf"`) | Headless DocGen API (PDF) + Apple/Google Wallet Passes (.pkpass) | **Modern UX & Performance:** Offline GPS lock-screen access; eliminates Flying Saucer CSS limits. |
| **Data Relationships** | Master-Detail (`Event` $\rightarrow$ `Reg` $\rightarrow$ `Payment`) | Lookup Relationship with Restricted Delete + DLRS rollups | **Audit Compliance:** Prevents accidental deletion of financial records; statutory tax compliance. |
| **Approval Logic** | Single static threshold (₹2,00,000 in CMDT) | Multi-Tier Matrix (`Approval_Matrix__mdt`) with category & amount routing | **Enterprise Governance:** Prevents executive approval fatigue; enforces proper delegation of authority. |

## 8. How to Present This in Your Viva ("The Ultimate Examiner Defense")

When your evaluator ("Sir") reviews your project and asks:  
*"Why didn't you integrate a real payment gateway or why did you use Master-Detail for payments?"*

> ### The Winning Answer for the Team:
> *"Sir, for our Phase 1 prototype and rapid deployment, we implemented a simulated event booking flow with Master-Detail rollups to demonstrate core Salesforce capabilities, declarative rollups, and UI responsiveness.  
> However, as part of our **Phase 2 Enterprise Architecture Roadmapping**, we have already authored a complete Production Remediation Report ([`ENTERPRISE_ARCHITECTURAL_RECOMMENDATIONS.md`](file:///c:/Users/10pri/Downloads/evmos%20saleforce/ENTERPRISE_ARCHITECTURAL_RECOMMENDATIONS.md)).  
> In that document, we evaluated and designed:
> 1. An Inbound HMAC-verified REST Webhook architecture for Razorpay/Stripe,
> 2. Decoupling the financial ledger into immutable Lookup relationships to prevent accidental cascade deletion of payment audits,
> 3. Replacing Visualforce PDF with an Apple/Google Wallet Pass microservice, and
> 4. Upgrading our Custom Metadata to a dynamic multi-tiered Delegation of Authority matrix.  
> We have the full architectural specifications and sequence diagrams ready."*

**Delivering this answer proves to the examiner that you didn't just build a project—you understand real-world software engineering, corporate security, and enterprise system design.**
